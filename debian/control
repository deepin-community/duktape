Package: duktape
Architecture: any

Description: embeddable Javascript engine
 Duktape is an embeddable Javascript engine, with a focus on portability
 and compact footprint.
 .
 Duktape is easy to integrate into a C/C++ project: add duktape.c, duktape.h,
 and duk_config.h to your build, and use the Duktape API to call Ecmascript
 functions from C code and vice versa.
 .
 The main features are
    - Embeddable, portable, compact: can run on platforms with
      256kB flash and 64kB system RAM
    - Ecmascript E5/E5.1 compliant, some features borrowed from
      Ecmascript E6
    - Khronos/ES6 TypedArray and Node.js Buffer bindings
    - Built-in debugger
    - Built-in regular expression engine
    - Built-in Unicode support
    - Minimal platform dependencies
    - Combined reference counting and mark-and-sweep garbage
      collection with finalization
    - Custom features like coroutines, built-in logging framework,
      and built-in CommonJS-based module loading framework
    - Property virtualization using a subset of Ecmascript E6 Proxy
      object
    - Bytecode dump/load for caching compiled functions
 .
